We are ones with the urge to create.

From the moment we picked up our first controller, we instinctively wanted to invent, to have fun creating and sharing our games.

We are not requested to do this, nor do we need this to survive. It is not just a pastime. For us, this is a way to connect and trade valuable experiences with an audience we might never meet. 

This is how we express ourselves. 

This is how the foreign experience us.
